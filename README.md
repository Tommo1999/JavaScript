Where’s Mario? — JavaScript Game

A fast, fun browser game built with HTML, CSS and JavaScript where the player searches for Mario (or any hidden character) in a busy scene. Great as a short demo, a portfolio piece, or a small coding project to practice DOM, event handling, timers and asset loading.

🎯 Game Overview

The player is presented with a scene (image or composed elements). Mario is hidden somewhere in the scene — click him as quickly as possible. The game tracks time, score, and optionally levels/locations. Misses can penalize time or score. Add more levels by swapping scenes or changing difficulty.
